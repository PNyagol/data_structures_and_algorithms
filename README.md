# Python Code Challenge

This repository contains Python code for a coding challenge with functions related to stacks, sequences, and dictionaries.

## Functions

1. **Stacks:**
   - `is_balanced(expression)`: Checks if an expression with parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

2. **Sequences (Lists/Tuples):**
   - `remove_duplicates(sequence)`: Removes duplicates from a sequence (list or tuple) while maintaining the original order.

3. **Dictionaries:**
   - `word_frequency(sentence)`: Returns a dictionary with the frequency of each word in a sentence, ignoring punctuation and case.

## Usage

Run `main_script.py` for sample test cases: python main_script.py
